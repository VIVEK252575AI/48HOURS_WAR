# 🚀 Java 48-Hour Hackathon Sprint — Day 1 ✅

Welcome to **Day 1** of my intense Java Hackathon Sprint!  
This repo documents my rapid learning & problem-solving journey where I covered **core Java basics + problem solving** in a focused hackathon-style challenge.

---

## ✅ Topics Covered Today:
- ✅ Input in Java (Scanner Class)
- ✅ Arithmetic Operations (Sum, Product, Area)
- ✅ Type Conversion
- ✅ Type Casting
- ✅ Type Promotion in Expressions
- ✅ How Java Code Runs (Behind the Scenes)

---

## 📚 Concepts Learned:
- Variables & Data Types
- Taking User Input (Scanner)
- Arithmetic Operators & Expressions
- Type Conversion & Casting
- Data Type Promotion Rules in Java

## ✨ Bonus Problems (Operator Practice from PDF):
I also solved additional Operator-based Java programs:
- Arithmetic & Logical Expressions  
- Conditionals with Logical Operators  
- Compound Assignment Operators  
- Nested Expressions with Complex Precedence  

📂 *(You can find these under `/Day-1/OperatorsQuestions/` folder.)*

## ✅ Key Takeaways Today:
- Got confident with Java’s syntax & arithmetic operations.
- Learned how Java handles **data type promotions** automatically.
- Practiced multiple programs to solidify my basics.
- Ready to move into **Loops + Patterns + Functions** tomorrow.

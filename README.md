Welcome to Day 1 of my intense Java Hackathon Sprint!
This repo documents my rapid learning & problem-solving journey where I covered core Java basics + problem solving in a focused hackathon-style challenge.

âœ… Topics Covered Today:
âœ… Input in Java (Scanner Class)

âœ… Arithmetic Operations (Sum, Product, Area)

âœ… Type Conversion

âœ… Type Casting

âœ… Type Promotion in Expressions

âœ… How Java Code Runs (Behind the Scenes)

ðŸ“š Concepts Learned:
Variables & Data Types

Taking User Input (Scanner)
